             directory

   auxil  :  farcolors.lua and farkeys.lua are built in the auxil directory

   all    :  All of the above targets are built


Steps required to build
------------------------
1. Edit user's settings in the file "config.mak".
2. Run: make [<target>]. See the description of available targets above.
   For 64-bit builds, run: make lib ARCH=-m64
